<h1 align="center">Web 3D Image Slider Effects</h1>

## Description
> This project consists of an interactive visual experience based on modern and minimalist web design built with <i>HTML</i>, focused on creating dynamic backgrounds and visual effects using advanced web technologies. 

> The interface leverages the power of <i>CSS</i> to apply animated gradients and transition effects in real time, providing an elegant and fluid environment. To enhance interaction, <i>JavaScript</i> is used to generate visual effects in the background, such as moving particles, soft lights, or interactive grids, offering an engaging and dynamic visual experience without relying on external images. 

> These technologies combined allow for the creation of a highly professional and attractive design, ideal for portfolios, corporate sites, or any page seeking to convey modernity, elegance, and a touch of interactivity.
